In this repo a chatbot application is shown that can be deployed on streamlit community cloud or run locally that communicates via API calls to a server on beam cloud. The beam cloud is running a Mistral large language model. The application also has an authentication feature that connects to google spread sheets and based on entered username and password, validates login and gives access to using chatbot.
